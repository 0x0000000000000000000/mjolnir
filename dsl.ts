/**
 * A format of messages designed to allow communication with a configurable
 * spamchecker designed around the Synapse Spamcheck API.
 * 
 * - We call an implementation of the Synapse Spamcheck API that supports this
 *   protocol a *Checker*.
 * - The Checker is configured to receive instructions in a set of rooms
 *   Room1, Room2, ... RoomN. This set of rooms does not change during the
 *   lifetime of the Checker.
 * - Any member of Room1, ..., RoomN with authorization to send messages
 *   (aka a *Controller*) can send instructions to the Checker. We expect
 *   that the Controller will be an implementation of Mj√∂lnir or Carlotta.
 *
 * A the time of this writing, the Checker supports only simple rules.
 * 
 * - A number of string properties are exposed to rules.
 * - A rule is a string property and a literal/regexp.
 * - During execution, if the regexp appears in the value of the string
 *    property, the message/user account creation request is rejected.
 * - Otherwise, it is accepted.
